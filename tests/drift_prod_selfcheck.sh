# drift_prod_selfcheck.sh — self-check for infra/deploy/check-drift.sh (#360). #360 schedules
# check-drift.sh's original five invariants unchanged (cadence + visibility only), and ADDS a sixth:
# every MDREVIEW_* key docker-compose.prod.yml declares for the `mdreview` service must be present in
# the running container's env. That sixth check exists because the first five would NOT have caught
# the incident that opened #360 -- MDREVIEW_SESSION_TTL_S sitting undeclared on the host for 12 days --
# since none of them reads that key. Runs anywhere: stubs `docker` and `ssh` on PATH, sets HOST=
# (local mode -- the exact invocation the new systemd unit uses) and HOME=<fixture> so the script's
# hardcoded `~/mdreview-deploy/...` reads resolve into a synthetic fixture, never the real host.
#
#   bash tests/drift_prod_selfcheck.sh    # exit 0 = pass
#
# WHY THIS DRIVES THE REAL SCRIPT rather than asserting on its text (same rationale as
# tests/drift_staging_selfcheck.sh / tests/custody_tripwire_selfcheck.py): a comparison that always
# says "ok" passes vacuously on a clean fixture. The only way to know it actually compares anything is
# to plant a divergence and require it to fail — then mutate the comparison itself and require THIS
# selfcheck to notice the detector went silent, by reusing the SAME positive assertion post-mutation
# (the #361 technique) rather than writing a new one that could itself be vacuous.
