"""Users + per-user API tokens (Phase 1 multi-user). One file <DATA_DIR>/users.json holds the
account map (canonical id provider:sub -> record) and hashed API-token digests. Stdlib only.

Auth model: oauth2-proxy enforces the invite allowlist BEFORE any request reaches the app, so a
request on the cookie plane is, by construction, an allowlisted user -> auto-provision on first
sign-in. The token plane is validated here against per-user HMAC digests (pepper from env, never on
disk), so a users.json leak alone cannot forge a token. Reads are lock-free (consistent with the
meta.json reads elsewhere); mutating methods assume the caller holds store.lock, like ReviewService.
