"""The hosted composition root (#67 priority 7 / custody Decision 1 — the fail-closed-BUILD core of
#109).

`build_hosted` is reached ONLY by `python -m mdreview.hosted` (the hosted Docker image's CMD). The
selection of the real owner-only policy is therefore a property of the BUILD, not of a runtime flag:
there is no env var in this path that yields OpenPolicy. A hosted build is consequently INCAPABLE of
serving with the ownership check off — the #97 root fault (MDREVIEW_REQUIRE_AUTH defaulting open
behind a secret-only guard) is not a reachable state here. This deliberately does NOT reintroduce a
"hosted defaults off" flag; the worst case for a misconfigured hosted build is refuse-to-boot, never
serve-open. The LOCAL tier (`python -m mdreview`) is untouched: it keeps OperatorIdentity/OpenPolicy
and its open, no-accounts promise by design.

The boot guards here are unconditional (independent of REQUIRE_AUTH): a hosted build refuses to start
without the session secret (and the token pepper; and the proxy secret while the transitional plane
is enabled); without MDREVIEW_OWNER_EMAIL (#67 H1 — so ownership is pinned to a configured email and
no stranger self-crowns); and without a resolvable email backend (#67 H2 — a real sender, or the dev
stub only behind an explicit MDREVIEW_ALLOW_STUB_EMAIL opt-in that logs a loud warning). config.py
additionally requires the session secret whenever REQUIRE_AUTH is on, so the existing transitional
path is covered too.
